# Chris Vim dotfiles

Hello! These are the dotfiles I use for my Linux setup as well as for vim.

Currently, I have moved from using Manjaro XFCE to Manjaro KDE so the files might not work for you if you are using something different.

For example, previously when I was using vim with the xfce4-terminal, I had a lot of issues with the terminal colours not working properly, so I had to add a lot of weird fixes to my vimrc. However, now that I moved over to using Konsole in KDE, the terminal colours have been working great and I in fact had to set the terminal colours to 256 (not sure if its 256 available colours or 24-colours).

Have fun and contact me if you have any questions about these!
